/*
Given an array where the element at the index i represents the price of a stock on day i,
find the maximum profit that you can gain by buying the stock once and then selling it.
Note: Stock can only be purchased on a single day and sold on a different day.
      If no profit can be achieved, we return zero.

Constraints:
* We canâ€™t sell before buying a stock, that is,
  the array index at which stock is bought will always be less than the index at which the stock is sold.
* 1<prices.length<10^5
* 0<=prices[i] <=10^5
