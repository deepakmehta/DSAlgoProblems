/*
Given a binary string s, the following two operations can be performed in any sequence:

* Remove the character at the start of the string s and append it to the end of the string.

* Pick any character from the string and flip its value. in other words, if its value is 0, it becomes 1 and vice versa.

Your task is to return the minimum number of type-2 operations that you need to perform before s becomes alternating.
