/*
Given the head of a singly linked list, reorder the list as if it were folded on itself.
For example, if the list is represented as follow
L0->L1-L2->............Ln-2->Ln-1->Ln->nullptr 
​
This is how you’ll reorder 
L0->Ln->L1->Ln-1->L2->Ln-2............nullptr
You don’t need to modify the values in the list’s nodes; only the links between nodes need to be changed.

Constraints:

The range of number of nodes in the list is [1,500]
−500≤ Node→value ≤500
