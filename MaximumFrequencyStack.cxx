/*
Design a stack-like data structure.
You should be able to push elements to this data structure and pop elements with maximum frequency.
You’ll need to implement the FreqStack class that should consist of the following:


FreqStack: This is a class used to declare a frequency stack.
Push(data): This is used to push an integer data onto the top of the stack.
Pop(): This is used to remove and return the most frequent element in the stack.

Note: If there is a tie for the most frequent element, then the most recently pushed element is removed and returned.

Constraints:
0≤value ≤10^9
At most, 2×10^3 calls will be made to Push() and Pop().
It is guaranteed that there will be at least one element in the stack before calling Pop().
*/


class FreqStack {
  public:
    // Use constructor to initialize the maxFrequency
    FreqStack() {
        
    }
    
    // Use push function to push the data into the FreqStack
    void push(int data) {
        // TODO: Write your code here
    }
    
    // Use the pop function to pop the data from the FreqStack
    int pop() {
        // TODO: Write your code here
        return -1;
    }
};
